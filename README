Jacks is a set of libraries that enable the Jack Audio 
Connection Kit APIs to be used from high-level languages like 
Perl, Python, Ruby, and Lua.

This is an experiment, pre-alpha quality, and untested.

Thanks for using Jacks (open to suggestions for a less 
presumptious name, we  are not part of the jack audio project).

              *** PRE ALPHA QUALITY!                         ***
              *** The messy build system is the biggest prob ***
              *** right now, but the session and sample-ing  ***
              *** works for me, all the unit tests pass      ***

Design:

1 - Jacks code should run in lock-step with jack callbacks.

2 - No async buffering nor buffer copying should be introduced by
    Jacks.

3 - Support lots of languages.


Implementation:

  - Written in C and SWIG
  - Build system uses autotools (sorry)
  - Build system tries to make lang-specific dist files
  - pthreads for IPC


Install:

  - see the INSTALL file


Usage:

  - see http://jackaudio.org/
  - perldoc jacks
  - look at example-clients dir under each language module in the
    modules dir
